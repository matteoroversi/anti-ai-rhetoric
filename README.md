# Anti-AI-Rhetoric

This prompt fixes the patterns that make AI writing sound like AI writing.

## The Problem

AI writing falls into predictable patterns:
- Hyperbolic language ("groundbreaking", "revolutionary", "unprecedented")
- Mechanical rhythm (uniform 10-15 word sentences)
- Decorative formatting (bold for emphasis, lists that fragment prose)
- Vague openings ("In today's rapidly changing world...")
- Business jargon ("synergy", "leverage", "paradigm shift")
- Empty intensifiers ("clearly", "obviously", "particularly")
- Rhetorical formulas ("Not X, but Y", "The real question is...")

Text that sounds impressive but says little.

## Core Principle

**Form follows function.** Every stylistic choice must serve the specific content, not automatic patterns or formulas.

## What It Changes

**Jargon:** Removes 60+ common business buzzwords, hyperbolic adjectives, and weak intensifiers.

**Structural patterns:** Eliminates rhetorical formulas used decoratively, forced triads, clickbait titles, pseudo-philosophical endings.

**Formatting:** Bold and lists only when they serve clarity, not decoration.

**Openings:** No vague scene-setting. Start with specific observation, data, or thesis.

**Sentence rhythm:** Requires at least one 30+ word sentence and one 5-8 word sentence every 3-4 paragraphs. Prevents uniform medium-length sentences.

**Examples:** Real names, dates, numbers - not "a company" or "research shows."

**Closings:** Concrete next step or implication, not philosophical drift.
